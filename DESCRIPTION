Description:  Computation of frequentist predictive distributions and prediction intervals for meta-analysis using confidence distributions. Confidence distributions for the average effect are obtained from the Edgington combined p-value function. Uncertainty in the estimate of the between-study heterogeneity is incorporated by use of the generalized heterogeneity statistic.
