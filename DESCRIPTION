Description: Frequentist predictive distributions and prediction intervals
    for random-effects meta-analysis using confidence distributions. Confidence
    distributions for the average effect are obtained from the Edgington
    combined p-value function.  Uncertainty in the estimate of the
    between-study heterogeneity is incorporated by use of the generalized
    heterogeneity statistic.
