\arguments{
\item{es}{Numeric vector of effect estimates from individual studies (length >= 2).}

\item{se}{Numeric vector of standard errors corresponding to each effect estimate (length >= 2).}

\item{method}{Either "FullCD" (recommended for practical application), "SimplifiedCD" or "FixedTau2". Check details for information.}

\item{level.pi}{Coverage level of the equi-tailed prediction interval (numeric, between 0 and 1).}

\item{n_samples}{Number of Monte Carlo samples used to construct the predictive distribution (default is 100,000).}

\item{method.tau2}{In case method is "FixedTau2" or "SimplifiedCD", this determines the method of estimating the between-study heterogeneity.
Check 'help(meta)' for information on estimation methods (default is "REML").}

\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{PI}{Prediction interval for a future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}}.}
\item{samples}{A matrix containing samples \eqn{\theta_{new}^*} from the predictive distribution ('theta_new'), samples \eqn{\mu^*} from the confidence distribution of the average effect ('mu') and samples \eqn{\tau^{2*}} from the confidence distribution of the between-study heterogeneity ('tau2').
The latter are not included in case \code{method = "FixedTau2"} is selected.}

\description{
Computes frequentist predictive distributions and prediction intervals for future effects
\eqn{\theta_{new}} in random-effects meta-analysis. Predictive distributions are adjusted for estimation uncertainty
through Edgington's confidence distributions of the average effect (\eqn{\mu}) and through an approximate confidence distribution of
the between-study heterogeneity (\eqn{\tau^2}).
Computation is performed using a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm generating independent samples.
}
\details{
Predictive distributions are constructed by integrating the assumed normal effect distribution \eqn{\theta_{new}} ~ N(\eqn{\mu}, \eqn{\tau^2}) over Edgington's confidence distribution
to account for uncertainty in \eqn{\mu} and over an approximate confidence distribution of the heterogeneity parameter to account for uncertainty in \eqn{\tau^2}.
The approximate confidence distribution of \eqn{\tau^2} is implied by the generalized heterogeneity statistic (Viechtbauer, 2006).

The function supports three methods:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"FullCD"}: Samples \eqn{\tau^{2*}} are drawn from the approximate confidence distribution of \eqn{\tau^2}. For each drawn
\eqn{\tau^{2*} }, a corresponding \eqn{\mu^*} is conditionally drawn from Edgington's confidence distribution (, which is conditional
on the heterogeneity parameter). For each pair (\eqn{\mu^*}, \eqn{\tau^{2*}}), a future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}^*} is drawn from
a N(\eqn{\mu^*}, \eqn{\tau^{2*}}). This method fully accounts for uncertainty in both parameters and the dependence of Edgington's
confidence distribution on the heterogeneity parameter.
\item \strong{"SimplifiedCD"}: This method generates samples \eqn{\tau^{2*}} from the confidence distribution of
\eqn{\tau^2}, but generates samples \eqn{\mu^*} using a simplified
approach. Specifically, samples \eqn{\mu^*} are drawn conditional on a fixed \eqn{\hat{\tau}^2}.
For each pair (\eqn{\mu^*}, \eqn{\tau^{2*}}), a future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}^*} is drawn from
a N(\eqn{\mu^*}, \eqn{\tau^{2*}}).
\item \strong{"FixedTau2"}: This method used a fixed estimate \eqn{\hat{\tau}^2}, and generates samples \eqn{\mu^*}
conditional on this fixed estimate. Samples \eqn{\theta_{new}^*} are generated from a N(\eqn{\mu^*}, \eqn{\hat{\tau}^2}).
}

The empirical distribution of the sampled \eqn{\theta_{new}^*} values serves as the estimated predictive
distribution of future effects. This distribution can be used to compute prediction intervals,
summarize predictive uncertainty, or generate visualizations.
