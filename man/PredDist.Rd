\description{
This function computes frequentist predictive distributions and prediction intervals for a future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}} in random-effects meta-analysis. Predictive distributions are constructed from confidence distributions of the average effect (\eqn{\mu}) and the between-study heterogeneity (\eqn{\tau^2}), using a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. It supports three methods: "FullCD" (recommended), "SimplifiedCD", and "FixedTau2".
}
\details{
Predictive distributions are constructed from the confidence distribution of the average effect
\eqn{\mu} and from the confidence distribution of heterogeneity parameter \eqn{\tau^2}. The confidence distribution of the
average effect \eqn{\mu} is obtained from the Edgington combined \eqn{p}-value function (Held et al., 2025).
The confidence distribution of the between-study heterogeneity parameter \eqn{\tau^2} is
derived from the generalized heterogeneity statistic (Viechtbauer, 2006).

The function supports three methods:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"FullCD"}: This method generates samples from the confidence distribution of
\eqn{\tau^2}, and for each sampled \eqn{\tau^2}, it computes the corresponding confidence
distribution of \eqn{\mu}. It then generates a sample of the future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}}
for each (\eqn{\tau^2}, \eqn{\mu}) pair. This is the most comprehensive method, as it fully
accounts for uncertainty in both parameters and the dependence of the Edgington combined \eqn{p}-value function on the heterogeneity parameter.
\item \strong{"SimplifiedCD"}: This method generates samples from the confidence distribution of
\eqn{\tau^2}, but computes the confidence distribution of \eqn{\mu} using a simplified
approach. Specifically, it uses a fixed \eqn{\tau^2} to compute the Edgington combined
\eqn{p}-value function, from which samples of \eqn{\mu} are drawn. It then generates a sample of
the future effect \eqn{\theta_{new}} for each (\eqn{\tau^2}, \eqn{\mu}) pair
\item \strong{"FixedTau2"}: This method assumes a fixed value for \eqn{\tau^2}, and uses it to compute
the confidence distribution of \eqn{\mu}. It does
not account for uncertainty in the estimation of \eqn{\tau^2}.
}

The empirical distribution of the sampled \eqn{\theta_{new}} values serves as the estimated predictive
distribution of future effects. This distribution can be used to compute prediction intervals,
summarize predictive uncertainty, or generate visualizations.
