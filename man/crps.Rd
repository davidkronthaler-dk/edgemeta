\title{Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A numeric vector of samples from the predictive distribution.}

\item{tn}{A numeric vector of values from the true distribution of future effects.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the mean CRPS across all observations.
}
\description{
Computes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for a predictive distribution using a Monte Carlo (MC) approximation.
The MC approximation follows the approach for the computation of the \emph{energy score} proposed by Gneiting et al. (2008).
To ensure computational efficiency, especially when handling large numbers of predictive samples or multiple future effect samples,
the Monte Carlo approximation is implemented with a C++ backend.
If multiple future effects are provided, the function returns the mean CRPS across all provided samples.

# True data-generating distribution
truth <- rnorm(100, 0, 3)
pd <- rnorm(1000, 0.2, 2.8)

# Compute CRPS
crps(pd, truth)
