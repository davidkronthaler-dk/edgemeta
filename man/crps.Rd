\title{Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)}
\usage{
crps(s, tn)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A numeric vector of samples from the predictive distribution.}

\item{tn}{A numeric vector of future truths.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the mean CRPS across all future truths.
}
\description{
Computes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for a predictive distribution using a Monte Carlo (MC) approximation.
The MC approximation follows the approach for the computation of the \emph{energy score} proposed by Gneiting et al. (2008).
To ensure computational efficiency, especially when handling large numbers of predictive samples or multiple future truths,
the Monte Carlo approximation is implemented with a C++ backend.
If multiple future truths are provided, the function returns the mean CRPS across all provided future truths.
}
\details{
A likely misconception is that supplying the same vector for both the predictive samples
\code{s} and the truths \code{tn} should result in a CRPS of zero. This is not the case,
unless the vector contains only a single unique element. The reason is that each observed
value in \code{tn} is evaluated against the \emph{entire} predictive distribution in \code{s}.
By contrast, if a truth value is evaluated against a predictive distribution that
places all of its mass at that same value (i.e., a point mass), the CRPS is indeed zero.

\examples{
# True data-generating distribution
truth <- rnorm(100, 0, 3)
pd <- rnorm(1000, 0.2, 2.8)

# Compute CRPS
crps(pd, truth)
